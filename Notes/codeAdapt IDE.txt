codeAdapt IDE.txt

Idea merge Code::Blocks PlugIn design with parts of CodeLite and Geany.

I do NOT like the looks of CodeLite way to busy; but, some features of it are very nice.

I like Geany and it uses GPL lic.

I like Code::Blocks; but, I wish to do some changes that are NOT likely to be accepted.

I wish to remove all but the Compiler Plugin from CB.
I will then replace the custom Scintilla editor with the standard Scintilla editor
I wish to have better support for custom makefile build projects.
I wish to use wxlua as the scripting engine.
I wish to target the MSys2 platform
I wish the build system to be CMake or premake.
I wish to use wxGTK instead of wxMSW.
I wish to use wx-config.exe to build the IDE.
See if I like wxCrafter. https://github.com/eranif/wxCrafterCB
