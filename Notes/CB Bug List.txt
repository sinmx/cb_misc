wxWidgets Wizard
   NO ISSUE: Checkmark for "Use __WXDEBUG__ and debug wxWidget Lib" 
      Does NOT seem to work with empty or other types ofprojects.
      Was user error; it works if you click yes/no on the popups correctly.

Might be bug or feature change (Partly done; needs more testing)
   Fix [PCH_INCLUDE] for wxWidget wizard (non wxSmith).
      ADDED [IF WANTUSERPCH]

NOT BUGs; but feature change below
   wxWidgets Wizard Project changes needed
      Use custom vars for WX_CFG, WX_SUFFIX, and WX_VERSION
      
      HOLD: Merge wxSmith template files into common files
         Looks to be to hard to merge; maybe bad idea for most files.
         The file app.cpp might be safe to do.
