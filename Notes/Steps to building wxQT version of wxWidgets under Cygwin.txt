Steps to building wxQT version of wxWidgets under Cygwin

Step 1: Have a recent version of Cygwin installed on the Windows PC.
 I used this 32 bit version uname -a output below
 "CYGWIN_NT-6.1 TimWin7-32 1.7.33-2(0.280/5/3) 2014-11-13 15:45 i686 Cygwin"

Step 2A: Install the Devel packages needed for wxWidgets configure/make
   make
   pkg-config and also do the recommended packages. 
     possible wxQT bug: internal wxWidgets package config does NOT know what to do about Qt5 on Cygwin

Step 2B: Install the wanted GCC Toolchain
   I used the i686-pc-cygwin Toolchain; On Cygwin64, a prefix of cygwin32- is used.
   	  gcc-core, gcc-g++, and also do the recommended packages.

Step 2C: Install the packages needed for wxQT
   Qt5 Libs Packages
      libQt5Gui-devel and also do the recommended packages.      

Step 2D: Install the optional packages; if wanted
   cppunit
   git

Step 3: Download wxWidgets source code 
 NOTE: Cygwin needs lf line endings; or you get errors trying to do configure
 
 Using Cywin Git
 # Option --depth=1 needed because of bad internet connection.
 
 git config --global core.eol lf
 
 git clone --depth=1 --origin upstream https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git

 git.exe status
 
 git fetch --depth=1000
 git fetch --depth=2000
 # Option --unshallow removes the depth setting above.
 git fetch --unshallow
 
 git.exe status
 git.exe checkout master
 
 git.exe pull upstream master
 
 $  git.exe checkout -b build/wxQT_PCH_FIXES origin/build/wxQT_PCH_FIXES

Step 4: Building wxQT
$  cd ~/devel/wxWidgets/wxWidgets

$  mkdir build_qt5_wx3.1.x_static_unicode
$  cd build_qt5_wx3.1.x_static_unicode
$  ../configure --prefix=/opt/wx/3.1.x \
      --with-qt \
      --disable-monolithic \
      --disable-shared \
      --host=i686-pc-cygwin \
      --enable-xrc \
      --with-libjpeg=builtin \
      --with-regex=builtin \
      --with-tiff=builtin \
      --disable-precomp-headers \
      --enable-unicode

## Reasons for the above configure options
The --with-qt selects the wxQT Toolkit.
The other --with- options are because sometime in the past I had issues using an wxWidgets build using the system version.
The --enable-xrc is because the Code::Blocks directions mentions it; I believe it is the default in wxWidgets
The --disable-shared is because the shared version has a linking error because Cygwin GCC uses Windows like export/import syntax that needs fixed.
The --disable-monolithic is the default and the best options for static; it is here to remind me to test --enable-monolithic under shared.
The --disable-precomp-headers is the common default under Windows GCCs; but, --enable-precomp-headers is the common default under Linux
The --host=i686-pc-cygwin selects the Compiler toolchain that will be used.
The --enable-unicode is to remind me the default is now Unicode
