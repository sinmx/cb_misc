Setting up MSys2 for building CodeBlocks.txt

Install MSys2 from http://msys2.github.io/

First update msys2 core components (if you have not done it yet): 
pacman -Sy
pacman -S bash pacman pacman-mirrors msys2-runtime

# You must exit out from MSYS2-shell, restart MSYS2-shell, then run below command, to complete rest of other components update:
pacman -Su

# Exit out of MSYS2-shell, restart MSYS2-shell, then you are ready to use MSYS2-shell.
# Note: for initial installation & setup, please also see this page http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/
# Here -S means "sync" (Add). And -U means add or upgrade; it requires an URL-like option I have yet to learn


# Install programs that are known to be needed
pacman -S wget                      # Not sure if this is needed
