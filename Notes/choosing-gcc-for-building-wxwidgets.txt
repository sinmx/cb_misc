Based on http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2011/06/choosing-gcc-for-building-wxwidgets.html

Let's summarize the choices in a concise list:

1.  Use makefiles: implies the use of MinGW compiler in DOS prompt.
2.  Use configure+make; then choose between
    a.  Using Cygwin and Cygwin compiler
        i.  Cygwin 32 bit and Cygwin 32 bit compiler
        ii. Cygwin 64 bit and Cygwin 32 bit compiler
        iii.Cygwin 64 bit and Cygwin 64 bit compiler
    b.  Using Cygwin and MinGW cross-compiler
        i.  MinGW64 (i686) 32 bit compiler
        ii. MinGW64 64 bit compiler
    c.  Using MSys2 and MinGW compiler
        i.  32 bit MinGW compiler
        ii. 64 bit MinGW compiler
