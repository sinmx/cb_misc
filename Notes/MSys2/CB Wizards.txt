CB Wizards and what needs edited
gtk         Fix Wizard to ask GTK version. GTK2 or GTK3.
sdl         Fix Wizard to ask SDL version.
            Fix Sample code to work with SDL2. Works OK with SDL 1. Linux Package: libsdl1.2debian and libsdl2-2.0-0
glfw        Fix Wizard to ask GLFW version. GLFW2 or GLFW3.
            Test Wizard under Linux using Packages libglfw-dev (2.7.2-1) and libglfw3-dev (3.0.4-1)
            Sample code is different for GLFW3 #include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
            GLFW 3.0 Replaced glfwOpenWindow with glfwCreateWindow.
            Version 3.0     Released on June 12, 2013
            Version 2.7.9   Released on June  6, 2013
opencv      Fix Wizard so Library can be found. Linux Package: libopencv-dev (Very Large Installation)
irrlicht    Fix Sample code. Linux Package: libirrlicht-dev (1.8.1+dfsg1-1 and others)
glut        Maybe fix Wizard to ask if using freeglut. Linux Package: freeglut3-dev

CB Wizards that already ask for Library version info.
wxwidgets
sfml        Best one to copy because it is simplier.

Testing of CB Wizards on Debian "Jessie"
sdl         SDL1 and SDL2 Tested Good.
gtk         GTK2 and GTK3 Tested Good.
glfw        Required CB Global Var of "glfw" with "/usr" as base. 
            GLFW2 Tested Good; include path of "GL" valid for Linux Debian Jessie.
            GLFW3 Tested Good; include path of "GLFW" valid for Linux Debian Jessie.
glut        Required CB Global Var of "glut" with "/usr" as base and "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" as lib. Tested Good; did NOT need to edit to use freeglut on Linux.
irrlicht    Required CB Global Var of "irrlicht" with "/usr" as base, "/usr/include/irrlicht" as include, and "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" as lib.
            Linux code has sample compile error. Linux using version 1.8.
