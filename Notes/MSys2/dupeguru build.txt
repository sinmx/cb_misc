For Linux (`--system-site-packages` is to be able to import PyQt):

    $ pyvenv --system-site-packages env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

With your virtualenv activated, you can build and run dupeGuru with these commands:

    $ python build.py
    $ python run.py

You can also package dupeGuru into an installable package with:

    $ python package.py

### Running tests

The complete test suite is ran with [Tox 1.7+][tox]. If you have it installed system-wide, you
don't even need to set up a virtualenv. Just `cd` into the root project folder and run `tox`.

If you don't have Tox system-wide, install it in your virtualenv with `pip install tox` and then
run `tox`.

You can also run automated tests without Tox. Extra requirements for running tests are in
`requirements-extra.txt`. So, you can do `pip install -r requirements-extra.txt` inside your
virtualenv and then `py.test core hscommon`
