Building wxMSW port with Win32 MSys2 backend
------------------------------------------------

The MSys2 website is http://www.msys2.org/

These building steps are NOT the normal way to build MSys2 MinGW packages.
But, they are a way the wxWidgets developers can test that wxWidgets
can build the wxMSW libraries under MSys2 MinGW.

For the MSys2 way please see https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages

Building steps:

#Note: The "#" is used in front of a comment to help the people who cut
#      and paste these directions.

#1. Install the mingw32 packages needed to build wxMSW using the 
#   configure/make build method. 
#   From the MSys2 prompt or MSys2 MinGW prompt:

#   The 32 bit Mingw packages are prefixed with "mingw-w64-i686-";
#   Change the prefix to "mingw-w64-x86_64-" if you wish to do 64 bit.

pacman -S --needed --noconfirm make
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-libjpeg-turbo
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-libpng
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-libtiff
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-gcc

# Packages that are needed but are normally installed already.
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-gcc-libs
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-expat
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-xz
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-zlib


#2. Build the wxMSW shared library
#2a.Open MSys2 MinGW Prompt
#   (These steps were tested on MinGW32; but, should work under MinGW64)
#2b.Use the cd command to change directory to the wxWidgets top folder.


#2c.Create the "build-msw-shared" folder to build the shared libraries
mkdir -p build-msw-shared

#2d.Configure wxWidgets
#   Option "--disable-precomp-headers" is NOT needed.
#   I am doing it to check for compile issues;
#   And, I think my old 32 bit Windows machine
#   works best with it disabled.
cd build-msw-shared && \
  ../configure --with-msw \
    --enable-shared \
    --disable-precomp-headers \
  && cd ..

#2e.make the wxMSW shared libraries
cd build-msw-shared && make && cd ..

#2f.add the wxMSW shared libraries to the path
export PATH=$PWD/build-msw-shared/lib:$PATH


#3  Build and run the minimal shared sample
#3a.Clean the minimal sample
cd build-msw-shared/samples/minimal && make clean && cd ../../..

#3b.Build the minimal sample
cd build-msw-shared/samples/minimal && make && cd ../../..

#3c.Run the minimal sample
./build-msw-shared/samples/minimal/minimal.exe


#4 Clean the shared samples
cd build-msw-shared/samples && make clean && cd ../..

#5  Build and run the typetest shared sample to verify MIME database works
cd build-msw-shared/samples/typetest && make && cd ../../..
./build-msw-shared/samples/typetest/typetest.exe

#6  Build and run the drawing shared sample
cd build-msw-shared/samples/drawing && make && cd ../../..
cd samples/drawing && ../../build-msw-shared/samples/drawing/drawing.exe && cd ../..

#7  Build and run the splash shared sample
cd build-msw-shared/samples/splash && make && cd ../../..
cd samples/splash && ../../build-msw-shared/samples/splash/splash.exe && cd ../..

#8  Build and run the widgets shared sample
cd build-msw-shared/samples/widgets && make && cd ../../..
cd samples/widgets && ../../build-msw-shared/samples/widgets/widgets.exe && cd ../..

#9  Build all the rest of the shared samples
cd build-msw-shared/samples && make && cd ../..
