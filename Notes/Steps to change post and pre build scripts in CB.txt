Add Custom var.
   $(CB_LIB)         CB_LIB               devel30              ../../../devel30
   $(CB_BIN)         CB_BIN               bin30                ../../../devel30
   $(CB_OBJ)         CB_OBJ               .objs30              ../../../.objs30

   $(CMD_MKDIR)
   CMD_IGNORE_ERROR     || exit 0            
   CMD_CP_UPDATE        cmd /c xcopy /D /Y   

   CB_SRC               ..\codeblocks\src    
   CB_BIN_FROM_SRC      ..\..\build\bin30    

$(CB_OBJ)/include

..\..\..\sdk\wxscintilla\include

Fix source code or CBP needed for PCH
   HeaderFixup                      code fix needed on most files.
   Games                            code fix needed on one file.

* cbp_build: Fixed Linux PCH building (Thanks stahta01).

Added CB custom var CB_OBJ
Added compiler option "-Winvalid-pch" and [-include "sdk.h"].
And, added include search path of "$(CB_OBJ)/include".
Moved some project level defines to windows target.
Needed to do code change with the compiler option [-include "sdk.h"],
added an guard around the include of "sdk.h" header.
