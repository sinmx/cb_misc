Required rules for using PCH properly under Windows
   1. The sdk_common.h file should only be included by sdk.h and sdk_precomp.h
   2. Use sdk.h instead of sdk_precomp.h in CB Plugins
   3. Do NOT include wx.h inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
   4. Do NOT include sdk.h from inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
   5. Do NOT include wxprec.h inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
   6. Do NOT include a header file before include sdk.h.
   6. Do NOT do a pragma before include sdk.h.
   8. Should have "-Winvalid-pch" warning set.
   9. Must have the folder containing sdk.h and sdk.h.gch in the search path!
      NOTE: The folder containing sdk.h.gch must before the sdk.h folder.
  10. Have the include of sdk.h guarded by macro suggested example below
      #ifndef CB_USING_CMDLINE_SDK_H_INCLUDE
Suggested rules for using PCH properly under Windows
   1. Use <sdk.h> instead of "sdk.h" in CB Plugins
   2. Try to avoid using CB_PRECOMP or WX_PRECOMP inside headers.
   3. Define CB_PRECOMP for sdk.h; do NOT define WX_PRECOMP as a Compiler command line option.
   4. Define WX_PRECOMP if wanted in sdk_common.h.
   5. After including sdk.h; Do use CB_PRECOMP to guard includes of headers included by the sdk.h PCH.
   6. After including sdk.h; Do use WX_PRECOMP to guard includes of headers included by the wxprec.h but not by sdk.h PCH.

Priority order to check PCH rules
   1. This sdk_common.h file should only be included by sdk.h and sdk_precomp.h
   2. Check src/include for issues
      A. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside header files.
      B. Do NOT include wx/wxprec.h from inside header files except for the sdk_common.h file.
      C. Do NOT have #pragma hdrstop in header file except for the sdk_common.h file.
      D. Do NOT include sdk.h or sdk_precomp.h inside the CB include folder.
      Needed to create and test a seperate patch to fix debuggermanager.h and xtra_res.h
      ToDo: created patch for debuggermanager.h
   3. Check src/sdk for issues
      A. Do NOT include sdk.h; instead include sdk_precomp.h inside the CB sdk folder.
      B. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from source files except for wxpropgrid, wxscintilla, and other sub-folders.
      The files scrollingdialog.cpp and xtra_res.cpp violant these rules.
      ToDo: Create patch for scrollingdialog.cpp and xtra_res.cpp
   4. Check src/src for issues
      A. Do NOT include sdk_precomp.h; instead include sdk.h inside the CB src folder.
      B. Do NOT have #pragma hdrstop in header file.
      C. Do NOT include sdk.h from inside header files.
      D. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside header files.
      E. Do NOT include wx/wxprec.h from inside header files.
      F. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside source files.
      ToDo: Fix switcherdlg.cpp, ipc.h, app.h, scriptconsole.h, and virtualbuildtargetsdlg.h
   5. Check src/plugins for issues
      A. Do NOT include sdk_precomp.h; instead include sdk.h inside a CB plugin folder.
      B. Do NOT have #pragma hdrstop in header file.
      C. Do NOT include sdk.h from inside header files.
      D. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside header files.
      E. Do NOT include wx/wxprec.h from inside header files.
